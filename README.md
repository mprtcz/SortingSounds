The application contains 4 controls and a button responsible for sorting start.
Controls let a user choose between different types of sorting algorythms, speed of exectution, size of an array to be sorted and whether the user wants a sound to be played during execution. 
In the botton there is a label which informs the user about how many comparisons chosen algorythm had made during sorting.
